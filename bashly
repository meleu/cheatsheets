## Bashly "Rules"

- `src/*.sh` are the subcommands
  - they need to be specified in the `src/bashly.yml`.
  - their code is going to be wrapped in a function.
  - if you want to use functions, declare them in `src/lib/*.sh` files.

- `src/lib/*.sh`
  - put your functions in these files
  - the file contents are going to be put in the top-level scope (therefore avoid commands outside functions)

- validators:
  - they go in `src/lib/validators/*.sh`
  - functions must be named with the `validate_` prefix
  - input is valid if the `validate_*` function generates no output

## My practices

- `bashly-settings.yml`
  - `var_aliases.args: ARGS`
  - `strict: "set -Eeo pipefail"`

- `src/lib/custom_commands.sh`
  - this is where I put my custom commands (e.g.: `curl --silent --location`)
  - a custom commands is always inside a function like `cmd_<command-name>`
    - example: `cmd_curl()`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```
